class InputMediaPhoto(InputMedia):
    """A photo to be sent inside an album.
    It is intended to be used with :obj:`~pyrogram.Client.send_media_group`.

    Parameters:
        media (``str``):
            Photo to send.
            Pass a file_id as string to send a photo that exists on the Telegram servers or
            pass a file path as string to upload a new photo that exists on your local machine.
            Sending photo by a URL is currently unsupported.

        caption (``str``, *optional*):
            Caption of the photo to be sent, 0-1024 characters.
            If not specified, the original caption is kept. Pass "" (empty string) to remove the caption.

        parse_mode (``str``, *optional*):
            By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles.
            You can combine both syntaxes together.
            Pass "markdown" or "md" to enable Markdown-style parsing only.
            Pass "html" to enable HTML-style parsing only.
            Pass None to completely disable style parsing.

        caption_entities (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.MessageEntity`):
            List of special entities that appear in the caption, which can be specified instead of *parse_mode*.
